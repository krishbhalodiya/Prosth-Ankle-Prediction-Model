# Sensor-Driven Deep Learning Model Project

This project simulates sensor data and trains a deep learning model to predict outputs (e.g., torque) based on the sensor readings. It is designed as a starting point for future real-world IoT applications.

## Installation

1. Create a virtual environment.
2. Install the dependencies:
